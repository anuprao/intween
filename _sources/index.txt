PiTweener v1.0 Documentation
============================

Welcome to PiTweener's documentation!

This library provides many equivalent functions of Flash's Caurina Tweener in
cpython 2, cpython 3 and jython 2, and uses the same set of excellent `easing
equations by Robert Penner`_. In a nut-shell, it allows you to move objects with
nice smooth acceleration and deceleration using a variety of methods. Plus you
don't have to worry about updating them. Any property that supports standard
mathematical operations can be tweened. This is particularly useful with
animations.

PyTweener
---------

PiTweener is a fork of pyTweener_. It was forked by pipeep (get it?), to address
a number of bugs in the pyTweener engine. In addition, PiTweener attempts to
match `python's PEP 8 guidelines`_.
